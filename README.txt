The purpose of this git repository is so that my work can be accessed by anyone who also has access to this git repository. This makes it easy for a grader such as Ming to download my directories and see my files on his own machine. 

My favorite assignment / lab was Wedo. I like the simpsons and it was a fun assignmnet without a lot of stress. It was assigned at a good time as it was when I still was not completely comfortable with web programming, but it helped me build confidence. 

I think that I have grown an immense amount since the start of this course. I knew the inspect element / developer tools existed, but I did not know anything about how the web worked. Now I feel more comfortable explaining how request response works and what goes into the actual programming of the web. 

The most important thing I learned in this course was how databases / storage systems work, including queries at the end of URLs. Knowing that data is stored / retrieved through methods such as POST / GET and that what those commands do is coded individually made sense of something that I otherwise just took for granted. Also, learning about queries and ? and variables in the URL made URLs way more clear as for the longest time they seemed like a jumbled, useless mess. 

Now that the course is finished, I would like to delve deeper into creating permanent applications. Seeing how it is pretty easy to create / edit fun things on the web made me want to make my own items and have them stick around for others to experience (like our username.github.io site). 

Thanks Ming!
